## 📁 File Locations

**Main folder:**
```
C:\Users\evanw\source\repos\evantest1_matrixmul\evantest1_matrixmul\
```

**Key files:**
- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `GITHUB_SETUP.md` - Upload guide ⭐ READ THIS NEXT
- `kernels/5_rectangular_tiling_with_cublas.cu` - Your best kernel

## ❓ Questions?

**How do I upload?**
→ Read `GITHUB_SETUP.md` (Option 1 is easiest!)

**Do I need Git installed?**
→ No! Use GitHub's web upload (Option 1)

**What about the old .cu files in root?**
→ They're ignored by .gitignore (use kernels/ folder)

**Can I still build with Visual Studio?**
→ Yes! Original .vcxproj files are untouched

## 🎓 Learning Value

This project taught you:
- ✅ GPU memory hierarchy (GMEM → L2 → L1 → SMEM → RF)
- ✅ Tiling strategies (block, warp, thread)
- ✅ Occupancy vs throughput tradeoffs
- ✅ Register management and spilling
- ✅ Memory coalescing and vectorization
- ✅ Profiling with Nsight Compute
- ✅ Real performance engineering

**You now understand GPU optimization better than 95% of new grads.**
